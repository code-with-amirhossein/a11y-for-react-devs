# More Complex Widgets

A more complex user experience should not mean a less accessible one. Whereas accessibility is most easily achieved by coding as close to HTML as possible, even the most complex widget can be coded accessibly.

Here we require knowledge of [ARIA Roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) as well as [ARIA States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#states_and_properties). These are toolboxes filled with HTML attributes that are fully supported in JSX and enable us to construct fully accessible, highly functional React components.

Each type of widget has a specific design pattern and is expected to function in a certain way by users and user agents alike:

- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) - Design Patterns and Examples](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- [Heydon Pickering - ARIA Examples](https://heydonworks.com/article/practical-aria-examples/)
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/)
