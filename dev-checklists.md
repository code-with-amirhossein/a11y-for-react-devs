# Development Checklists

There are a number of tools we can use to assist in the creation of accessible web applications.

## Keyboard Navigation

By far the easiest and also one of the most important checks is to test if your entire website can be reached and used with the keyboard alone. Do this by:

1. Disconnecting your mouse.
2. Using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to browse.
3. Using `Enter` to activate elements.
4. Where required, using your keyboard arrow keys to interact with some elements, such as menus and dropdowns.

## Increase text size to 200%!

Is the content still readable? Does increasing the text size cause content to overlap?

## Straw Testing

Proximity issues can arise when interface elements are designed far apart from one another. This mostly affects people with **low-vision** who rely on zoom software.

What happens when someone uses zoom software is that they only see a small fraction of the screen at once. Usually, the zoomed portion of the screen follows the current position of the mouse pointer or keyboard cursor.

As a result of someone only being able to see a small section at a time, oftentimes when attempting to complete a task, content is difficult to find or may be missed entirely.

How do we test to ensure there are minimal to no proximity issues with our design? One relatively simple and effective method is to perform what's called, "the straw test."
