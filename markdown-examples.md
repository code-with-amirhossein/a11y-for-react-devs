## Other Points for Consideration

### Setting the language

Indicate the human language of page texts as screen reader software uses this to select the correct voice settings:

- [WebAIM - Document Language](https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/#language)

### Setting the document title

Set the document `<title>` to correctly describe the current page content as this ensures that the user remains aware of the current page context:

- [WCAG - Understanding the Document Title Requirement](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html)

We can set this in React using the [React Document Title Component](https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title).

### Color contrast

Ensure that all readable text on your website has sufficient color contrast to remain maximally readable by users with low vision:

- [WCAG - Understanding the Color Contrast Requirement](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)
- [Everything About Color Contrast And Why You Should Rethink It](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/color-contrast-tips-and-tools-for-accessibility/)
- [A11yProject - What is Color Contrast](https://a11yproject.com/posts/what-is-color-contrast/)

It can be tedious to manually calculate the proper color combinations for all cases in your website so instead, you can [calculate an entire accessible color palette with Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/).

Both the aXe and WAVE tools mentioned below also include color contrast tests and will report on contrast errors.

If you want to extend your contrast testing abilities you can use these tools:

- [WebAIM - Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [The Paciello Group - Color Contrast Analyzer](https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)

## Development and Testing Tools

There are a number of tools we can use to assist in the creation of accessible web applications.

### The keyboard

By far the easiest and also one of the most important checks is to test if your entire website can be reached and used with the keyboard alone. Do this by:

1. Disconnecting your mouse.
2. Using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to browse.
3. Using `Enter` to activate elements.
4. Where required, using your keyboard arrow keys to interact with some elements, such as menus and dropdowns.

### Development assistance

We can check some accessibility features directly in our JSX code. Often intellisense checks are already provided in JSX aware IDE’s for the ARIA roles, states and properties. We also have access to the following tool:

#### eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

The [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) plugin for ESLint provides AST linting feedback regarding accessibility issues in your JSX. Many IDE’s allow you to integrate these findings directly into code analysis and source code windows.

### Testing accessibility in the browser

A number of tools exist that can run accessibility audits on web pages in your browser. Please use them in combination with other accessibility checks mentioned here as they can only test the technical accessibility of your HTML.

#### aXe, aXe-core and react-axe

Deque Systems offers [aXe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) for automated and end-to-end accessibility tests of your applications. This module includes integrations for Selenium.

[The Accessibility Engine](https://www.deque.com/products/axe/) or aXe, is an accessibility inspector browser extension built on `aXe-core`.

You can also use the [@axe-core/react](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/react) module to report these accessibility findings directly to the console while developing and debugging.

#### WebAIM WAVE

The [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) is another accessibility browser extension.

#### Accessibility inspectors and the Accessibility Tree

[The Accessibility Tree](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/the-browser-accessibility-tree/) is a subset of the DOM tree that contains accessible objects for every DOM element that should be exposed to assistive technology, such as screen readers.

In some browsers we can easily view the accessibility information for each element in the accessibility tree:

- [Using the Accessibility Inspector in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector)
- [Using the Accessibility Inspector in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference#pane)
- [Using the Accessibility Inspector in OS X Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html)

### Screen readers

Testing with a screen reader should form part of your accessibility tests.

Please note that browser / screen reader combinations matter. It is recommended that you test your application in the browser best suited to your screen reader of choice.

### Commonly Used Screen Readers

#### NVDA in Firefox

[NonVisual Desktop Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/) or NVDA is an open source Windows screen reader that is widely used.
