# Tools

We can check some accessibility features directly in our JSX code. Often intellisense checks are already provided in JSX aware IDE’s for the ARIA roles, states and properties. We also have access to the following tool:

## eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

The [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) plugin for ESLint provides AST linting feedback regarding accessibility issues in your JSX. Many IDE’s allow you to integrate these findings directly into code analysis and source code windows.

## Testing accessibility in the browser

A number of tools exist that can run accessibility audits on web pages in your browser. Please use them in combination with other accessibility checks mentioned here as they can only test the technical accessibility of your HTML.

### aXe, aXe-core and react-axe

Deque Systems offers [aXe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) for automated and end-to-end accessibility tests of your applications. This module includes integrations for Selenium.

[The Accessibility Engine](https://www.deque.com/products/axe/) or aXe, is an accessibility inspector browser extension built on `aXe-core`.

You can also use the [@axe-core/react](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/react) module to report these accessibility findings directly to the console while developing and debugging.

### WebAIM WAVE

The [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) is another accessibility browser extension.

### Accessibility inspectors and the Accessibility Tree

[The Accessibility Tree](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/the-browser-accessibility-tree/) is a subset of the DOM tree that contains accessible objects for every DOM element that should be exposed to assistive technology, such as screen readers.

In some browsers we can easily view the accessibility information for each element in the accessibility tree:

- [Using the Accessibility Inspector in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector)
- [Using the Accessibility Inspector in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference#pane)
- [Using the Accessibility Inspector in OS X Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html)

## Screen readers

Testing with a screen reader should form part of your accessibility tests.

Please note that browser / screen reader combinations matter. It is recommended that you test your application in the browser best suited to your screen reader of choice.
